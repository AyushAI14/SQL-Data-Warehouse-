# SQL-Data-Warehouse

## What is Data Warehouse 
A data warehouse is a **central storage system that collects data from multiple sources, cleans it, organizes it, and stores it for reporting, analytics, and business decisions.**
It stores historical data and is optimized for analysis, not daily transactions.

### Key idea

Instead of data being scattered in different systems (CRM, sales DB, marketing tool), a warehouse brings it all into **one place** so you can analyze it easily.

### Example (real-world)

Flipkart collects data from:

* Orders database
* Payments system
* Delivery tracking
* Customer support system

All this data goes into a data warehouse like **Snowflake / Redshift / BigQuery**.
